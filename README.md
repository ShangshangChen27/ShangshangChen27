# Hi, I'm Shangshang 👋

UBC graduate | Python  
Focused on NLP and Agent AI engineering

## 🎯 Goal

Build a solid Agent AI engineering portfolio aligned with
industry Agent / LLM system roles,
with an emphasis on:
- NLP as decision modules
- Agent control & evaluation
- Engineering-oriented design

## 🧭 NLP → Agent Engineering Roadmap

This repository tracks my learning and project work towards
Agent AI engineering roles, focusing on NLP, agent systems,
and evaluation.

## 📦 Planned Projects

- [ ] Project 1: Agent Router (Intent Classification)  
      *Text classification model used as an Agent decision / routing module*

- [ ] Project 2: Single-Agent with Tool & Control Loop  
      *Agent with planning, tool usage, and termination conditions*

- [ ] Project 3: Multi-Agent System with Evaluation  
      *Planner / Worker / Critic agents with metrics such as success rate and latency*

- [ ] Project 4: Agent Engineering Toolkit (CLI / Config)  
      *Lightweight tooling to configure, run, and evaluate agent systems*

## 🧰 Tech Stack (in progress)

- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
